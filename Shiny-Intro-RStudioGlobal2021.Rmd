# Overview & Expectations
  
#### Workshop Goal: 
  
1. Understand what Shiny is

2. Basic structure of a Shiny application

3. How to make your own Shiny app 

---
  
### Assumptions: 
  
- Some familiarity with basic R programming
- Defining and calling functions
- Loading datasets and packages
- No Shiny/HTML/JavaScript background assumed
- `ggplot`: not essential, but helpful
  - examples will use ggplot
  - Base `R` plotting can be used in Shiny

# What is Shiny?

--

> Framework that allows R users to create interactive web apps without knowing anything* about web design. 

--

> *Ok, a small amount of basic web design is helpful
---
# Web design in 1 slide

Shiny abstracts away the key technologies underlying modern web design:

--

#### HTML

- Hypertext Markup Language
- building blocks of web pages
- Structured documents that your web browser can interpret

--

#### CSS

- Cascading style sheets
- Separation of content (HTML) and styling (CSS)
- Used to describe formatting, look and feel of an web page

--

#### JavaScript

- Scripting language 
- Enables interactive web pages
- Usually executed within a users web browser

## How do I share my app?

### shinyapps.io

- Hosted service by RStudio
- Free basic plan, subscription for more features/authentication
- Very easy to use and deploy your work publicly 

--

### RStudio Connect

- Publishing platform for teams
- Part of RStudio's enterprise level solutions

--

### Host it yourself

- Or host it yourself on your own servers
- Requires specialized knowledge
